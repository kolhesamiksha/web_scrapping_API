Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet. This data is usually saved in a local file so that it can be manipulated and analyzed as needed.

Web scraping applications (or ‘bots’) are programmed to visit websites, grab the relevant pages and extract useful information.
